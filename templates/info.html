            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p id="Text1">
                Depression in teens
                has also been proven to be a crucial factor in a student's academic
                performance and concentration. Additionally, in New York there are six
                deaths per every 100,000 people in the same age group of 15-19 caused by
                self harm. Even though this is not as many teens
                dying as there are in the US as a whole, every life matters. A few causes
                of the recent increase in these numbers are lack of knowledge on teen mental
                health and difficulty to access professional help. Around 45% of all people
                in the US consider themselves to know about mental health, this means there
                are plenty of others who still have more to learn. There are available
                resources to inform oneself on mental health issues as well as resources in
                school for students. However, these resources may not be able to help as
                much as listening to a professional or someone else's firsthand experience
                would be able to.

            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p id="Text">
                We noticed this unfilled niche and decided to make a website to fill it. Our
                website has many features that are not present in other mental health websites,
                such as a chat room that allows students to speak with other students having the
                same issues. In addition, we will soon have a way for students to contact a
                professional, making it easier to contact someone who is knowledgeable about thier
                specific problem.
