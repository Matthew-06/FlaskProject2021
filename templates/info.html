            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p id="Text">
                Many people today tend to ignore the present mental health issues among 
                students in New York City. In 2019, when the COVID-19 pandemic started, 
                depression among teens from the ages of 15-19 spiked by an overwhelming 
                35.9%. Over the past year with online school and Zoom classes, one can 
                only imagine how much this percentage has increased. Depression in teens 
                has also been proven to be a crucial factor in a student's academic 
                performance and concentration. Additionally, in New York there are six 
                deaths per every 100,000 people in the same age group of 15-19 caused by 
                self harm. Even though this is not as many teens 
                dying as there are in the US as a whole, every life matters. A few causes 
                of the recent increase in these numbers are lack of knowledge on teen mental 
                health and difficulty to access professional help. Around 45% of all people 
                in the US consider themselves to know about mental health, this means there 
                are plenty of others who still have more to learn. There are available 
                resources to inform oneself on mental health issues as well as resources in 
                school for students. However, these resources may not be able to help as 
                much as a professional would be able to.
